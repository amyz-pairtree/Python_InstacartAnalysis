Python Scripts (Jupyter Lab) for Instacart Online Grocery data analysis project: 
Customer Segmentation and Revenue Insights

## Project Overview: 
**Instacart** (est.2012) is a *grocery delivery and pick-up service*, accessed via website and mobile app. The object of this project is to analyze at least two-years of sales data (2017-c.2019) to **uncover customer behaviors and product purchase trends**. The goal is to leverage customer segmentation and revneu insights to support the design of targeted marketing campaigns. 
#### Pt. 1: Time Trends: Understanding Shopper Behavior Across Days and Hours
Customer segmentation starts with understanding shopping schedules, particularly the hour of the day. What opportunities exist, at what specific times and on what days, to enhance company performance further? 
#### Pt. 2: Product Categories: Customer-Driven Metrics and Rankings
Before describing "Who is buying what," we explore "What is being bought". Bustomer groups can be defined from countless perspectives. By focusing first o the concrete product data at hand, we can leverage observable patterns to ground how we infer (and strategize for) different customer groups. 
#### Pt. 3: Customer Segmentation by Demographic Group (Income Level & Family Size)
Thus far, we've focused on customer segments based on shopping times: early birds, midday shoppers, evening shoppers, and night owls. In this final section, we shift to a new layer of segmentation: demographic groups. By considering factors like income level and family size, we can gain deeper insights into customer behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies tailored to these segments. 

## Conclusion: Actionable Insights for Customer Segmentation
### Key Takeaways:

**Time Trends:** Customer behavior fluctuates throughout the day, resulting in different revenue drivers for the company. These sales trends phenomena (e.g., â€˜Perfect Storm,â€™ â€˜Pricier Totals,â€™ â€˜Traffic Surge,â€™ â€˜Revenue Slowdownâ€™) suggest different purchasing priorities that targeted ad campaigns can address.

**Product Categories:** Different product categories exhibit varied levels of reordering potential and revenue generation. Identifying high-value departments that also have room for improvement in retention can guide marketing strategies toward increasing repeat purchases and advertising newer, more expensive products.

**Demographic Groups:** Demographics play a crucial role in shaping purchasing behaviors. For example, low-income groups tend to purchase more in snack categories, while high-income groups display higher non-reordering tendencies in certain categories. These insights suggest opportunities for more targeted marketing and product positioning.

### Strategic Implications:

Monitor and Leverage Fluctuations: Be proactive in adjusting marketing efforts to the time-based and demographic fluctuations weâ€™ve identified. Timing campaigns to align with these changes can enhance customer engagement and retention.

Explore Customer Adventurousness & Repeat Business: Target non-reordering customers with promotions that inspire them to explore new products or categories, while also encouraging repeat business through loyalty programs and personalized offers for those who have already purchased.

Deepen Demographic Nuance: While weâ€™ve captured broad trends, continued segmentation and further analysis of demographic groups can provide even more nuanced insights for tailored marketing strategies.

Optimize Revenue Efficiency: Focus on departments with high revenue per order but lower reordering potential. Developing strategies to encourage repeat business in these areas can drive both immediate and long-term growth.
